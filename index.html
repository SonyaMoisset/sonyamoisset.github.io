                Her partnership on shaping the roadmap, ensuring estimates were as accurate as we could get them and making sure we balanced time to deliver against effort/volunteering hours was amazing. We wouldn’t have succeeded without her!

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most talked about technologies in cybersecurity. Driven by the rising sophistication of cyber threats and large talent shortages, organizations are turning to AI as a force multiplier for security teams. But integrating AI into security workflows requires thoughtful planning and evaluation. Cybersecurity leaders need reliable data to justify the business case and return on investment (ROI) compared to existing tools and processes.</p></a>

            <p>Ethical hacking is important because it helps organizations identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by cybercriminals. Ethical hackers can provide valuable insights into a system's security posture and recommend improvements to mitigate the risk of a successful attack. </p></a>

            <p>Ethical hacking refers to the practice of using hacking techniques to identify and expose vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers use their skills and knowledge to help organizations and businesses identify security weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Ethical hacking can include a range of activities, from scanning and penetration testing to social engineering and physical security testing.</p></a>

            <p>The role of reporting and reports in ethical hacking is critical. Without proper reporting, the results of an ethical hacking engagement may not be effectively communicated to the relevant stakeholders, and remediation efforts may be inadequate or delayed. Reports are the primary means by which ethical hackers communicate their findings and recommendations to their clients.</p></a>

With the rise of technology, our personal and professional lives are increasingly dependent on computer systems and networks. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, with the potential to cause significant harm to individuals, organizations, and even nations. Ethical hacking helps prevent such attacks by identifying weaknesses in systems and networks before they can be exploited by malicious actors.</p></a>
